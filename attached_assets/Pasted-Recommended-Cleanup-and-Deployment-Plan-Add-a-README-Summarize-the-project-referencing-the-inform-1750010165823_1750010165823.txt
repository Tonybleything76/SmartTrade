Recommended Cleanup and Deployment Plan

Add a README

Summarize the project, referencing the information now in replit.md (system architecture, agent roles, required API keys, and deployment strategy). Include setup steps, environment variables, how to run the web interface, and typical workflows.

Consolidate Dependency Management

Maintain dependencies in pyproject.toml and optionally generate a requirements.txt for users who prefer pip install -r requirements.txt.

Document installation with pip install . (or pip install -e .) to ensure dependencies match the versions defined in pyproject.toml.

Environment Configuration

Create an example .env file listing OPENAI_API_KEY, SERPAPI_API_KEY, optional LINKEDIN_ACCESS_TOKEN, etc., using the same names referenced in utils/config.py and main.py.

Update documentation to instruct users to copy .env.example to .env and edit it with their credentials.

Simplify Execution

Provide a lightweight launcher script or Makefile with commands such as make run (to start python main.py) and make web for launching only the web interface.

Ensure main.py checks the .env file and loads environment variables.

Organize Project Structure

Add a top-level src/ directory and move code inside (e.g., agents/, utils/, workflow.py, web_interface.py, etc.). Update pyproject.toml to reference src as the package root. This helps packaging and prevents namespace issues.

Include a tests/ directory with at least minimal unit tests for each agent to serve as a starting point.

Docker Support (optional)

Provide a simple Dockerfile installing dependencies from pyproject.toml and running python main.py on container start. Expose port 5000 as defined in replit.md.

Logging and Data Persistence

utils/logger.py already supports JSON logging; ensure log output location is configurable via environment variables. Document where logs are stored.

Consider persisting scheduler state or workflow history to a file or database to avoid losing data on restart.

Deployment & Training Tips

Outline how to create API keys (OpenAI, SerpAPI, LinkedIn) and how to test the system with dummy credentials.

Recommend running on a small server or within Replit, but also show how to run locally with python main.py (web interface at http://localhost:5000 as seen in main.py logs).

Implementing these steps will clarify the projectâ€™s structure, make setup straightforward, and allow you to begin using and iterating on your agentic consulting system quickly.
